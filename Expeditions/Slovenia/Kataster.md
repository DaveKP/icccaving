Title: Kataster
Type: wiki



Basically, Form A is for new caves, Form B is for updates to registered
caves and Form E is for survey information.

Via Miha Cekada, head of the Cave Registry of the Speleological
Association of Slovenia

The procedure including the forms is extensively described in
<http://www.jamarska-zveza.si/kataster/navodila.html> There is an
English version (in construction) at
<http://www.jamarska-zveza.si/cave_registry/instructions.html> The most
appropriate option is to fill in the Slovenian form in Slovene, but you
may opt for an English one as well. Try to fill in as many forms as you
can, with special emphasys on the metric data (location, dimensions). A
survey is a must, however, if you haven't measured the cave extensively,
a sketch is possible, or even a sketch of the upper part of the cave.
