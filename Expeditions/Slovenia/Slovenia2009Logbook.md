Jarv's Rigging notes - Oct 09
-----------------------------

### Vrtnarija

-   Laurel fully Derigged, metal + slings taken out
-   Urinal series ropes pulled up




-   Zimmer rope pulled up
-   Bellow zimmer 'fully derigged' - JKP, gmail 8th Oct 09




-   Rest of main pitch series left fully rigged?
-   Any deviation krabs rescued if remembered




-   Happy Monday derigged, ropes coiled at top (hopefully out
    of stream!). Believe I took metal work out.
-   Pitch named Sue - rope pulled up + I believe I derigged the rebelay
    so you could kick loose boulders down on first trip
-   Walk the line - far side pulled up + coiled, near side (climb) left
    fully rigged
-   2 minutes to midnight - rope pulled up to rebelay (+30m)
-   Wet Hammer - metalwork derigged + taken out, as rock was oozing
    water + already rusting things, yet no drips?!
-   Mirage canyon - metalwork taken out, believe I took rope back to
    bottom of dark tranquil. Dried to take sling deviation out, but was
    too cunning in original placement.
-   **Rest of Kangaroo --&gt; Surface left fully rigged**

**Took all carabiners off deviations \[if we remembered to\]**





-   Unless otherwise noted, left fully rigged





### M2

-   Based on hearsay at Bivi,
    -   Left fully rigged for the October Boys to sort out!
    -   Believe was left (08--&gt;09) with higher pitches rope pulled
        up, Silos and below fully rigged.
