### Notes from unboxing

Impressively small, offers multiple points of reference for measurement
(front of unit, position of tripod screw attachment, rear of unit,
flick-knife plastic spike \~40mm long that appears centred on optical
axis of measurement).

Note 90% humidity maximum below - suspect cave fog will truly screw it
up!

Will bring into the lab one day & hook it up to a silicon detector +
'scope to see what sort of measurement pulses it is sending out. Offers
a 0.5s - 4s measurement time, so I suspect it is taking many and looking
for wide variations / having elections to decide on the true value. I
suspect a chopper will suitably confuse it :) *Jarv - torturing
electronics as ever...*
