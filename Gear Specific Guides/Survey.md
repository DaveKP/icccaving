**SAP**

Automated survey clino/compass (fluxgate?) with logging to memory card.
No built in laser distance finder as of yet, but its coming. Talking to
Pybus (OUCC) at BPF, most laser rangefinders have random ferrous metals
in the optics / containers, which throws compass off (i.e. can't house
together, yet). Ł250 per unit cost, rather crusty user interface - but
certainly the way things are going.

**Tape Lengths**

Regarding the necessary length of a tape: From G.W. 2007 survex data,
795 tape lengths were easily extracted (by grep + regex).

-   56/795 \~ 7% &gt; 15.00m in length
-   2/795 \~ 0% &gt; 30.00m in length

<http://www.toolshopdirect.co.uk> Seems cheapest for the Lufkin tape
measures:

-   15m for Ł23 inc. VAT
-   30m for Ł35.54
