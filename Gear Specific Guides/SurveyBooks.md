Laser Printed Surveys
---------------------

We've made a couple of survey books, printed 4-up on a normal A4 sheet
to be guillotined and comb-bound to make our own survey books.

Contact the club for the SVG (Inkscape) originals.

15 Leg from-to with LRUD

###

'arrow style' 13 legs with LRUD and duplicate station column (to make
which station LRUD applies to explicit)

We didn't make this: just a blue feint 10x5x1mm multiweight A4 graph
paper sheet Generated by <http://incompetech.com/graphpaper/> where you
can also find all kinds of weird and wonderful specialist papers to
print.

Does waterproof paper at more sensible (bulk) prices. A4 Laser-printable
250 sheets for ÂŁ44.22. (i.e. 4p per made up survey page)

**Update Nov 2007** Bought ourselves 250 sheets, used it for printable
cave descriptions in duplex in a normal office laser printer - extremely
impressive, mud just washes off, very tough, no tearing. Survived a very
wet giants round trip with lots of consultation & still absolutely
legigable!
