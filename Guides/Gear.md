New or Second Hand?
-------------------

Almost every item of caving equipment (from thermal underwear to rope)
is an essential piece of safety equipment, as without it - you're liable
to die. However, there is a difference between things such as SRT
equipment, whose failure would result in death and for which simply
inspecting its quality is insufficent, and things for which failure
(such as holes in your furry) is far more clear.

**Things ok to buy secondhand / cheaply** Furry, wellies, oversuit,
thermals, Bottles, SRT Bags, Rucksacks, Tents, books

**Things never ok** Rope, slings, metalwork, harnesses, battery belts
(used to belay)

**Things dubiously** Lights, batteries

Basically - use your common sense. Quite often, its still best to buy
some things (such as wellies) new as they'll wear much better.
