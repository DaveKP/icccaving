Car hire is almost always too expensive to be worth it - the information below is quite old!

Sixt <http://www.sixt.co.uk/> have a hire place in Olympia. Not open on
Sundays.

In Sept 2008, booking for a sensible caving weekend 5 weeks in advance
with the cheapest pos was Ł95.

Avis <http://www.avis.co.uk> have one in Earls Court, just off Warwick
Way (20 Seagrave Rd, SW6 1RX), near the big Tescos. They have out of
hours return.

Price \~Ł110 for same as above, Sept 08. Ł224.26 for 10day hire over
Christmas for economy 4 seater.

Alamo <https://www.alamo.co.uk> have an office in Kennington (SW9 OJJ),
and will do a micro car (website has amazing graphics, with little, med
& big passengers - inviting a squeezing comp!) for Ł63. In Fulham (SW6
2JR) the same options are Ł77. Ł14 for going South of the River - hah!
Vauxhall Corsa 10 day hire over christmas (winter tour) \~Ł250.

Young driver surcharge of Ł9 pd (23-24), or Ł15 pd (21-22). Weird rule
where if you book for &gt;5days, they fill up for you & charge a
complete tank of petrol. Mmm, driving home on fumes to fight the
fascists.
