What to do and when if you want to go caving.

As long as possible in Advance
------------------------------

###Organise drivers

Trips need Drivers. Without enough people to drive the minibus, nothing
will happen. Once you have drivers, or the expectation of drivers, start
a list collecting names. 12 people is a good number in a 15 seater
minibus, before having to resort to such faff as the roof rack (though
this is not too much extra effort if you have the leaders and a good plan for the weekend).

-   Trips to the Wales and Mendips involve about 4hrs drive, and are
    good for non-SRT trips.
-   Trips to Yorkshire and Derbyshire involve about 6 and 5hrs drive
    respectively, and are better for SRT trips.

A trip to Mendips / Wales is possible with just one driver, wheras a
solo driving trip to Yorkshire would be extremely unpleasent. Of course,
you ideally want many more - as the driver could become ill over the
weekend.

###Get cave permits

Permits for the classics (Lost Johns', Gaping Ghyll,  can be tricky to get if you wait until the term itself. As soon as you  have a plan, get the permits! 

- The [CNCC website](http://www.cncc.org.uk/access/) is a fantastic resource for finding out what the access requirements are for Yorkshire caves.
- Derbyshire tends to be turn up and pay the landowner a fee
- Wales and Mendip vary between open access, permits, and fees.

Google for up to date info.

The Term Before
---------------

###Book the Minibus. 

For a weekend trip, our typical times are from 17:00 on Friday to 23:59
on Sunday.

###Book a hut 

Choose a hut, and book it. The various region club's websites are are pretty good, and often have a booking calendar. The wardens are usually pretty good at email.

Our general hut preference is as follows:

-   **Yorkshire** Greenclose (NPC) for general caving, BPF (RRCPC) if one intends to do Saturday trips in Easeghyll
-   **Derbyshire** The TSG, followed by the Orpheus.
-   **Wales** WSG for general caving, CSS (Whitewalls) for Aggy.
-   **Mendips** Belfry (BEC) for party atmosphere, SMCC for its fine collection of spoons, or Wessex to shave 5 minutes off the walk to Swildons.


2 weeks in advance
------------------

The minibus booking should have been processed, and the person making the booking should have received a confirmation email. CHECK THOSE DATES! Don't end up with a minibus supposedly returning at 11:59am on Sunday, or one that you can only pick up at 6am on Saturday!

###Email everyone

Make sure everyone knows the time to meet at stores, what caves we're doing etc. Make sure fresher's get a nice email explaining what to bring and what to expect.

Tuesday before
--------------

###Pack Kit

Make sure that everyone releases that they're coming at this point; that everything is booked & that all is go! Try to get as many people as possible to pack on this Tuesday. It makes Friday a lot less hectic.


The Fateful Friday
------------------

###Well before 5pm

- Make sure you've packed kit for everyone who didn't pack kit for themselves.
- Pick up keys from SAC; probably filling in some forms at the time. They'll tell you what and where. Check the minibus over before the SAC closes so you can try for a replacement if its broken.
- Submit an 'Activity Registration' on eActivities. This requires a list of people going on the trip.
- Pick up any hut keys if they've been posted down. Or make sure you have any pin codes for doors or lock boxes and know where the hut it (get a postcode, have a scout on streetview).

###Just before leaving

- Sort out the freshers. Someone should be down at stores to open up, make sure everyone packs everything necessary & etc.
- Make sure you've got everything. Here's a rough guide: [ThingsToBring](ThingsToBring.md)...
- Pick up the minibus (you'll need a driver). Make sure they sign the hire form, and do all the magic checks. Its acceptable to drive over to outside stores before doing all the checks - but at least make sure it has 4 wheels + etc. 

###On the way

- Shopping. This is a dark art. Its tricky to give a complete 'typical' shop list as tastes change, offers come and go etc. Never the less, here is a rough guide: [ThingsToBuy](ThingsToBuy.md) Aim for less Â£5 per person per day. Don't forget to check what was left over from the last weekends, and also to occasionally buy the non-perishables (spices, pepper, etc.)
