**Tesco** is where 1 in 6 British pounds are spent. There is a Mega
Tesco at Earls Court, at the end of the M4 (where we turn off for the
SWCC), near Warwick off the M40 and next to Derby where we come off the
M1. This is why the caving club spends roughly 5 in 6 pounds at Tesco.

Breakfast
---------

Porridge is nice; even better with tinned peach slices, banana or orange
to go in it. You need more milk if you have porridge.

Cooked breakfast is the norm:

-   Sausages (1 per person per day is usually enough)
-   Beans (1 tin per day per 5ish people)
-   Eggs ( 1 per person per day)
-   Bacon (1 per person per day)
-   Mushrooms (1 big pack per day for a full trip)
-   Toast (See bread below)





Suppers
-------

-   **Chilli**: Kidney beans, Tinned toms, soya/beef mince, Chillis,
    Onions, Garlic, Carrots, Celery, RICE.
-   **Curry**: Buy a **Curry Paste** not a curry sauce! Balti works very
    well, most people can take the heat, and you can bulk it out nicely
    with tinned toms. Then Onion, Garlic, Parsnips, frozen peas, etc.
    & RICE.
-   **Pasta Sauce**: Get Olive oil, garlic, onion, celery, tinned toms,
    peppers, aubergine, mushrooms.





Cave Snacks
-----------

-   Mars Bars & Snickers are the classics
    -   But look to see if the Tesco own brand rip-offs are anywhere
        about; they're good + cheap!
-   Malt Loaves; Jamaican Ginger cake are pretty special!
-   Marzipan is good for epic trips
-   Recently trialed, beef jerky type stuff is pretty good (though
    take water)





Bread
-----

-   Medium slice is just right
-   Generally 2/3 a loaf per person per weekend (YMMV)
-   Generally 2/3 wholemeal, 1/3 white for the traditional lads





Misc things
-----------

-   Butter (Lurpack rocks)
-   Tea (Yorkshire or Tet's; not Medium Quality)
-   Coffee (Tesco Value is actually drinkable!)
-   Vegetable Boullion - tastes better than stockcubes, and just pour
    for more (Nb; approx half can for full 14 person meal)
-   CHEESE!
-   Apple pies (Tesco Value) are nice hut and van food
