UG Food
-------

-   Pita bread + humus work really well
-   Apples perversely nice





------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jarv bought a copy of [Lipsmackin' Vegetarian
Backpackin'](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uFilAhOQj7UC&dq=vegetarian+backpacking&ei=om7gR-PQEYuuzgT-8emRDw)
which is actually surprisingly good - interesting boiling water +
ziplock bag of ingredients super-meals that could be prep'd for UG camp.

Ideas from Sailing 2006...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The voice of (bitter) experience suggests that most meals will be
concocted by throwing a load of ingredients into the pressure cooker,
pressurising until soft & then eating. Pasta is a no-no as can't be
pressur'ised, and wastes water + fuel otherwise. Maybe macoroni +
cheese?
