That Concorde Photo:
--------------------

Zenit EM camera on Bulb (zenit's lock open without needing a seperate
remote trigger) with a 49mm Helios lens (standard) at F4. Super cheap
200ASA Bonusprint colour-print film. Flash was fired every \~10m, mostly
at Rebelays and sometimes between. It was I believe one Jan's usual
flashes, I think with a guide number of around 50. Total exposure was
around 15minutes. Ł13 on eBay Zenit, Ł2 film, Ł5 developing - best Ł20
I've ever spent!

Spot-beam of miglights is strong enough to appear in photos as a rather
sickly green spot; omni isn't generally strong enough.





Long Exposure Digital Shots
---------------------------

Do you love noise? My Little A520 spews noise across the print. Best
results involve the following gimp flowchart:

-   Speckle Reduction
-   Gaussian blur with Pixel=1.6 (or more, if shot out of focus & so not
    worsened by blurring)
-   Unsharp mask with Pix\~1.2 . Amount tuned for effect.





What Camera?
------------

Dave Wilson uses fully mechanical Rollei 35s, and has this to say: *The
35LEDs take mercury batteries (PX27s?) for metering, which aren't
obtainable these days, but there are some fixes available (from the
Small Battery Company, I think). I have skylight filters on all the
cameras to protect the lenses, and I think I have a couple of ND4s for
surface shooting in bright light with fast film (the shutter only goes
down to 1/500.*





Jarv's Cameras
--------------

35mm Ricoh GR1s/v. Bought from eBay for \~Ł100 smackerones. Small enough
to fit in my Peli 1030, and with a built-in timed exposure mode & both
infinite focus & hyperfocal overrides, crystal perfect 28mm lens. Whoah.
Took up mountain in lieu of SLR (Mig 2007) and was much impressed by
quality of prints, less impressed by quality of digitisation from film.

Zenit-E - Helios 49mm lens (see Concorde shot above), and cheap 28mm
F3.5 lens. So manual it hurts. Would probably survive nuclear war. Was
quite possibly designed so.

Canon AE-1, with 50mm SSC F1.4 lens and 28mm F3.5 lens. Have two bodies.
Unfortunately design is one where the shutter is held open by battery
power - so not so good for super super long exposure.





Filter for Fireflys
-------------------

People use filters to block vis and let through IR from flashes to
trigger fireflies. People generally use exposed slide film or PVC tape.
With firefly comes a small patch of ND filter (I assume transparent in
IR). Should probably place in specto to check :)
