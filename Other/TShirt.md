*Philosophy*: The general design conensus is:

-   Avoid witty sayings - they're not witty on the 999th rereading
-   No gallows humour - this is offputting to new-members
-   Do try for an original design

**2005** shirt design
<http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/caving/photo_archive/t-shirt/back_mockup.html>

Was printed with ???. Cost was \~Ł10 per t-shirt, about Ł15 for a Hoody.
Three colours, including an opaque white. Alignment was good (&lt;1mm),
and screen-print has shown to be extremely hard wearing. Max.
screenprint size was just sub A3.

**2007** design
<http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/caving/photo_archive/t-shirt/2007_design/cavingt.html>

Was printed with [Megashirts](http://www.erewhon.co.uk/), two
colours front & back. No alignment as monochrome print. Resolution of
print was below that of the 2004 design - lots of ink bleed. But they
were incredibly cheap - Ł5 per t-shirt. Tel: 01797 363 499
