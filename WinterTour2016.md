## Friday

A prompt escape from South Ken, enabled by some great preparation thanks to Tanguy and others, was sabotaged by a rather circuitous Google-enabled route via Hammersmith to the M4. We were also in a minibus with a disabled sound system, which also had the classic knackered transit character of not wanting to get into first gear. 

The weather was mild, the troops keen, and Tesco deliveries converging on the NPC. Things bodded well for a great week of caving.
