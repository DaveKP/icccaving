## Friday

A prompt escape from South Ken, enabled by some great preparation thanks to Tanguy and others, was sabotaged by a rather circuitous Google-enabled route via Hammersmith to the M4. We were also in a minibus with a disabled sound system, which also had the classic knackered transit character of not wanting to get into first gear. 

The weather was mild, the troops keen, and Tesco deliveries converging on the NPC. Things bodded well for a great week of caving.

My phone buzzed and I looked down at it. Jarv has started writing a trip report! How exciting I thought, reading it out load for the benefit of everyone. Not wanting to miss out on the fun I started writing as well, and this is the result.

Also not wanting to be left out I made my first ever trip report contribution by typing this while watching Community. I hadn't decided whether to leave at 8.30 or 9.00 yet. I wonder if I'll just be able to push this without someone responsible checking it first. UPDATE: Someone did have to check it first. Bother!
